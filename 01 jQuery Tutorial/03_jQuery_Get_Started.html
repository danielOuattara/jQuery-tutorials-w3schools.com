<!--Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
======================================

There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

 > Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
 > Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google


Downloading jQuery
====================

There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

  > Production version - this is for your live website because it has been
    minified and compressed
  > Development version - this is for testing and development
    (uncompressed and readable code)

Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with
the HTML script src="" element (notice that the <script> tag should be inside
the head element.

<head>
<script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>

Tip: Place the downloaded file in the same directory as the pages where
---- you wish to use it.


jQuery CDN
============

If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it
from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Google hosts jQuery: Google CDN

Advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google:

Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google when visiting another
site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site,
which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that
once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server
closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.                -->
