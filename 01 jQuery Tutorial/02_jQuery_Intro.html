<!-- The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on
your website.


What You Should Already Know
===============================

Before you start studying jQuery, you should have a basic knowledge of:

  > HTML
  > CSS
  > JavaScript


What is jQuery ?
================

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your
website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code
to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line
of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like
AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

 > HTML/DOM manipulation
 > CSS manipulation
 > HTML event methods
 > Effects and animations
 > AJAX
 > Utilities

Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.

Why jQuery ?
============

There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably
the most popular, and also the most extendable.

Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as: Google, Microsoft,
IBM, Netflix


Will jQuery work in all browsers ?
===================================

The jQuery team knows all about cross-browser issues, and they have written this
knowledge into the jQuery library. jQuery will run exactly the same in all major
browsers.                                                                    -->
